        <h1 id="White-Sox-apply-for-sports-betting-license-in-Illinois"><a href="#White-Sox-apply-for-sports-betting-license-in-Illinois" class="headerlink" title="White Sox apply for sports betting license in Illinois"></a>White Sox apply for sports betting license in Illinois</h1><p>The Chicago White Sox submitted an application to the Illinois Gaming Board on Friday to become a licensed sports betting operator in the state.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to submit our application and look forward to working with the Illinois Gaming Board on this new gaming opportunity,” said Brooks Boyer, White Sox senior vice president of sales and marketing.</p>
<p>The move comes as no surprise, as the team has been vocal about their plans to get into the sports betting market. In February, White Sox executive vice chairman Jerry Reinsdorf testified before a state House committee in support of legalizing sports betting in Illinois.</p>
<p>At that hearing, Reinsdorf said that his team was already exploring its options for a potential sportsbook at Guaranteed Rate Field, home of the White Sox. He also mentioned that he expected other professional sports teams in the state to do the same.</p>
<p>If approved, the White Sox would become just the second professional sports team in Illinois to offer sports betting, joining the NBA’s Chicago Bulls. The Bulls launched a mobile app for their fans earlier this year that allows them to bet on games both in-game and pre-game.</p>
<h1 id="Chicago-White-Sox-among-first-in-line-for-new-sports-betting-licenses"><a href="#Chicago-White-Sox-among-first-in-line-for-new-sports-betting-licenses" class="headerlink" title="Chicago White Sox among first in line for new sports betting licenses"></a>Chicago White Sox among first in line for new sports betting licenses</h1><p>The Chicago White Sox are among the first in line for new sports betting licenses, as news of the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision on the matter has teams preparing for a potential windfall.</p>
<p>While other leagues, such as the NFL and NBA, have been hesitant to fully embrace sports betting, Major League Baseball has been much more open to the idea, with team owners seeing it as an opportunity to grow the game.</p>
<p>“Any kind of revenue increase is good for baseball,” said White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf.</p>
<p>At present, only Nevada and Delaware offer full-scale sports betting, but that is expected to change if the Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey. That state is fighting a federal law that bans gambling on sporting events outside of those two states.</p>
<p>Sports betting is a $150 billion industry in the United States, with most of that money being wagered illegally. If legalized, that number could grow significantly, providing a new stream of revenue for professional sports leagues and teams.</p>
<p>The NBA has already begun preparing for legalized sports betting by forming a partnership with MGM Resorts International. That partnership gives MGM exclusive rights to offer betting on NBA games both in Las Vegas and across the country.</p>
<p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been less receptive to legalized gambling, but he may be forced to change his stance if it becomes legal nationwide. The NFL generates about $13 billion annually from television deals, and most of that money comes from advertising during games. Advertisers may be less willing to buy ad space if fans can simply place bets on games instead of watching them.</p>
<p>Leagues will likely seek a cut of any future gambling profits, just as they do with television contracts and other sources of revenue. How much they can earn remains to be seen, but it’s safe to say that teams and leagues stand to make a lot of money from legalized sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-betting-could-be-coming-to-Illinois-and-the-White-Sox-are-ready"><a href="#Sports-betting-could-be-coming-to-Illinois-and-the-White-Sox-are-ready" class="headerlink" title="Sports betting could be coming to Illinois, and the White Sox are ready"></a>Sports betting could be coming to Illinois, and the White Sox are ready</h1><p>In May, the Illinois state legislature voted to allow sports betting in the state. The measure now awaits the signature of Governor J. B. Pritzker, who has voiced his support for it. If it becomes law, Illinois will join a growing number of states that offer legal sports betting.</p>
<p>Illinois residents have been betting illegally on sports for years. Now they may be able to do so legally, and the White Sox are ready to take advantage of that fact. In a recent interview, White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said that he expects the legalization of sports betting to create a new market for the team’s sponsors and partners.</p>
<p>Reinsdorf is not the only one who sees potential in legalized sports betting. Many businesses see it as a way to generate revenue, and many states see it as a way to help finance their budgets. Delaware, for example, is expecting to bring in $9 million in revenue from sports betting in its first year of operation.</p>
<p>Sports betting is big business, and it is only going to get bigger as more states legalize it. The White Sox are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth, and I expect them to be successful in attracting new sponsors and partners.</p>
<h1 id="Chicago-White-Sox-want-in-on-legalized-sports-betting"><a href="#Chicago-White-Sox-want-in-on-legalized-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Chicago White Sox want in on legalized sports betting"></a>Chicago White Sox want in on legalized sports betting</h1><p>In light of the US Supreme Court’s repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May, which opened the door for states to legalize sports betting, the Chicago White Sox have submitted a proposal to Illinois lawmakers to allow them to be involved in sports betting.</p>
<p>“The Sox would like a piece of that action,” said Adam Grossman, White Sox senior vice president of marketing and communications.</p>
<p>Grossman noted that if the state were to legalize sports betting, the Sox want a percentage of the bets placed on their games.</p>
<p>“We just think it’s a natural extension of our brand and what we do,” Grossman said. “It’s something that as more states legalize it, we’re going to keep pounding the pavement and trying to make sure Illinois is one of those states.”</p>
<p>While no formal proposal has been put forth yet, Illinois lawmakers are looking into the possibility of legalizing sports betting this year.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-issues-first-batch-of-sports-betting-licenses-Chicago-White-Sox-among-recipients"><a href="#Illinois-issues-first-batch-of-sports-betting-licenses-Chicago-White-Sox-among-recipients" class="headerlink" title="Illinois issues first batch of sports betting licenses, Chicago White Sox among recipients"></a>Illinois issues first batch of sports betting licenses, Chicago White Sox among recipients</h1><p>Illinois became the first state to issue sports betting licenses on Tuesday, with several prominent Chicago-area teams among the recipients.</p>
<p>The Chicago White Sox, Blackhawks, Bulls, and Bears all received licenses, as did the Illinois Lottery. The licenses were granted as part of a new law legalizing sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting day for Illinois as we launch our sports betting industry,” said Gov. J.B. Pritzker in a statement. “These licenses will create jobs and revenue for the state, and I look forward to seeing our residents and visitors enjoy this new amenity at our world-class casinos and sports venues.”</p>
<p>Sports betting will be available at nine casinos in Illinois, as well as at Soldier Field and Wrigley Field. Bettors will be able to place wagers on events ranging from professional baseball and basketball games to college football and basketball matchups.</p>
<p>The Illinois Gaming Board issued the licenses after reviewing applications from over two dozen potential operators. The first bets could be placed as soon as this weekend.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports betting in Illinois has been met with mixed reactions. Some lawmakers and casino owners are hailing it as a major revenue generator for the state, while others express concerns about the potential for gambling addiction.</p>
<p>There is also some uncertainty about how the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent ruling on sports betting will impact the market in Illinois. That decision overturned a federal ban on sports betting in most states, opening up the possibility for other states to legalize it in the coming months and years.</p>
