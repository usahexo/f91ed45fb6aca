<h1 id="Who-was-Flaubert"><a href="#Who-was-Flaubert" class="headerlink" title="Who was Flaubert?"></a>Who was Flaubert?</h1><p>The French author Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880) was one of the most important and influential writers of the 19th century. Although he published only a single novel in his lifetime, Madame Bovary, Flaubert exerted a massive influence on subsequent literary movements and developed a reputation as one of the greatest prose stylists in the French language.</p>
<p>Born in Rouen, France, Flaubert came from a privileged background; his father was a successful physician. He showed an early interest in literature and began to write poems and short stories while still a teenager. After completing his formal education, he traveled extensively throughout Europe, spending time in Spain, Italy, Germany, and Egypt. In 1846, he settled down in Paris and began writing seriously.</p>
<p>Madame Bovary, which tells the story of an adulterous woman trapped in a stifling marriage, was initially banned by French authorities for its explicit sexual content. However, it was eventually published and became an instant success. Over the course of his career, Flaubert wrote other novels, including Sentimental Education and Salammbo, as well as numerous essays and letters. He also worked as a journalist and translated some of the works of Charles Dickens into French.</p>
<p>Flaubert’s precise writing style—known as “flauberism”–has been widely imitated by subsequent authors. He died in 1880 at the age of 59.</p>
<h1 id="Where-is-Denver"><a href="#Where-is-Denver" class="headerlink" title="Where is Denver?"></a>Where is Denver?</h1><p>Denver is the capital of Colorado, located in the central part of the state. The city is surrounded by the Rocky Mountains to the west and north, and is about an hour’s drive from both Rocky Mountain National Park and Pikes Peak. Denver is also a short drive from several other major mountain ski areas, including Vail and Aspen.</p>
<p>The city of Denver was founded in 1858 as a mining town, and quickly grew into a bustling metropolis with a population of over 600,000. Today, Denver is still a major center for the mining industry, but has also become a hub for high-tech businesses and aerospace companies. The city’s economy is now based largely on services and tourism, with over 16 million visitors coming to Denver each year.</p>
<p>Denver is home to a number of cultural attractions, including the Denver Art Museum, which houses one of the largest collections of American art in the country, and the Colorado History Museum. The city also boasts a lively arts scene, with several theaters and concert venues presenting a wide range of performances throughout the year. Outdoor recreation is another popular pastime in Denver, with world-class skiing and snowboarding just minutes away in the Rocky Mountains, as well as hiking, biking, and rafting nearby.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-a-flaubert"><a href="#What-is-a-flaubert" class="headerlink" title="What is a flaubert?"></a>What is a flaubert?</h1><p>One of the great questions of the 20th century is “What is a flaubert?” scholars and thinkers have long debated the answer to this question with no consensus reached.</p>
<p>Some say that a flaubert is a type of cheese, while others believe it to be a kind of sausage. Still others claim that it is a machine used to make waffles. And yet, still others maintain that a flaubert is simply an elusive creature that has never been seen by human eyes.</p>
<p>So what is a flaubert? The answer remains shrouded in mystery. But whatever it may be, one thing is for sure: it’s something worth searching for.</p>
