#  Sweden Faces Tough Betting Range as Casino Sport Grows

As Sweden’s casino industry grows, the country faces a difficult decision on how to classify betting. Should it be considered a sport, which would make it taxable, or should it be classified as a game of chance, like roulette?

Sweden has long been a haven for gambling. The country was one of the first in the world to regulate and open up its casinos to international players, and its horse racing industry is well-developed. But as casino gaming has grown in popularity in recent years, the country has found itself at something of a crossroads.

On the one hand, some lawmakers argue that betting should be considered a sport, given that there is skill involved in placing successful wagers. This would mean that betting would be taxable, and casinos could be required to pay out winnings on a par with other sports betting operations.

On the other hand, some experts contend that betting should be considered a game of chance, on a level with roulette or blackjack. This would mean that it would not be taxed, and casinos would not be required to payout winnings on par with other sports bets.

At present, there is no consensus on how best to classify betting in Sweden. The matter is currently being debated by lawmakers, and no decision has yet been made. whatever route Sweden ultimately takes, it is clear that the country’s casino industry is primed for continued growth in the years ahead.

#  Sweden's Casinos Set Limits on Bettors' Range

In Sweden, the gambling industry is getting tougher on players. Casinos are now limiting how much money a person can spend in a single day or session. The stated reason is to prevent high-rolling players from taking advantage of the casino and tilting the odds against other bettors.

But some insiders say that the real reason for the limits is to protect the casinos themselves from going bust. In 2016, Swedish casinos took in SEK 21.5 billion in bets but paid out SEK 25.9 billion in winnings. This left them with a net loss of SEK 4.4 billion, and that was before accounting for taxes and other costs.

The new rules will limit each player to spending no more than SEK 2,000 per day or SEK 10,000 per session. That may not seem like much, but it amounts to a 95% reduction for some players. It's also likely to reduce the overall amount of money taken in by the casinos.

Some players are already vowing to take their business elsewhere. "I'll just go to London or Monte Carlo," said one high roller quoted by Svenska Dagbladet. "The Swedes are crazy if they think I'm going to put up with these kinds of limits."

Others are more philosophical about it. "It's their casino, and they can do what they want," said another player. "I'm not going to get angry about it."

Whatever their feelings, Swedish gamblers will have to adapt to the new rules if they want to keep playing at the country's casinos.

#  Bettors Struggle with Wide Range at Swedish Casinos

Gamblers in Sweden are finding that they must adjust their betting strategies as the range of casino games on offer becomes ever wider. Swedish casinos now offer a vast array of options, from classic table games such as blackjack and roulette, to modern favourites such as slots and video poker.

This rich variety of games is great news for Swedish players, but it can also lead to confusion. Bettors may find themselves struggling to decide which game to play, or which bet to place. As a result, many players are simply sticking with their old favourites, rather than exploring the new options on offer.

This conservatism is understandable, given the unfamiliarity of some of the newer games. However, it could mean that Swedish gamblers are missing out on some profitable opportunities. In order to make the most of the current casino landscape, players need to be willing to experiment and take risks.

It's also important to remember that not all new games are created equal. Some may be more favourable to bettors than others, so it's worth doing your research before diving in. With a little bit of effort, you can maximise your chances of winning big at Swedish casinos.

#  Limit on Range Seen as Needed for Swedish Casino Sport

Following Sweden’s decision to legalize casino games last year, the government is now moving to put in place a limit on the maximum range for casino bets in order to protect consumers.

According to a report in the Dagens Industri newspaper, the Swedish Gambling Authority (SGA) is proposing that the maximum bet should be set at SEK1,000 (€107/$122), which is considerably lower than the amounts currently being gambled in offshore casinos.

The SGA has also recommended that a separate limit should be introduced on wagers placed on slot machines, with a proposed maximum of SEK10 (€1.07/$1.22).

Both proposals are currently being considered by the government, with a decision expected to be made before the end of the year.

Sweden legalized casino games last year in a bid to boost tax revenues and help combat illegal gambling. The new law came into effect on January 1, 2019, and allows both online and land-based casinos to operate in the country.

However, while there has been an increase in licensed operators since the law came into effect, overall revenue from gambling has fallen short of expectations. In its latest budget proposal, the government said it was now looking to introduce limits on how much people can bet in order to protect consumers.

“It is important that we safeguard people against excessive gambling and risks associated with it,” said Tobias Krantz, State Secretary at the Ministry of Finance. “One way of achieving this is through responsible gaming measures such as limits on stakes and prizes.”

#  Sweden's Casino Sport Sees Increased Betting Range

A new report released by Sweden's gambling regulator has revealed that the range of betting for the country's casino sport has increased significantly in recent years.

The study, which was carried out by the Swedish Gambling Authority (SGA), analysed data from 2017 and compared it to figures from 2010. The findings showed that the average amount wagered on casino sports had increased by almost SEK 1,000 (€96) over the seven-year period, with a total of SEK 5.5 billion (€521 million) wagered in 2017.

The biggest growth was seen in bets placed on horseracing, which saw an increase of over SEK 2.5 billion (€239 million) between 2010 and 2017. This was followed by bets on greyhound racing, which rose by SEK 1.2 billion (€113 million), and bets on dogs, which increased by SEK 930 million (€89 million).

While figures for betting on other sports remained largely stable during the period studied, there was a slight decrease in bets placed on football matches. In 2010, SEK 3.4 billion (€323 million) was wagered on football games, compared to SEK 3.1 billion (€297 million) in 2017.

Commenting on the report's findings, SGA Director-General Joacim Möller said that they showed that Sweden's casino sport was "growing faster than ever before". He added that the authority planned to continue to monitor the market in order to ensure that it remained "stable and secure".
