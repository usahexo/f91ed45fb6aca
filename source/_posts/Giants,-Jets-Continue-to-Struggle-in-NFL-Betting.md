#  Giants, Jets Continue to Struggle in NFL Betting

The New York Giants and the New York Jets both had rough starts to the NFL betting season. The Giants are now 0-5 while the Jets sit at 1-4.

For the Giants, the problems have been many. Odell Beckham Jr. has not been himself this season and the offense as a whole has not been able to put up points. The defense has also been porous, giving up an average of 28 points per game.

The Jets started off the season with a win over the Detroit Lions, but have since only won one game against the Cleveland Browns. In that game, quarterback Sam Darnold looked good, throwing for two touchdowns and no interceptions. However, in the other three games he has played, he has thrown six interceptions.

The biggest issue for both teams is their lack of consistency. They can look good one week and then terrible the next. This makes it difficult to predict how they will do from week to week and makes betting on them a risky proposition.

#  What Does Decide On Mean In Sports Betting?

Decide on is one of the most important verbs when it comes to sports betting. It is a verb which means to choose one option or course of action from two or more possibilities. When making a bet, you are essentially deciding on who you believe will win the contest.

There are a few different factors which go into deciding on a bet. The first is obviously the odds. You want to find the best possible odds for the bet you want to make. You can do this by looking at different websites or by checking out the odds offered by different bookmakers.

Another thing you need to take into account is how likely each outcome is. You don't want to put your money down on a bet that has very low odds, because the chances of you winning are slim. Conversely, you don't want to bet on an outcome that is very likely, because the payout will be small if you do win.

You also need to take into account your own personal betting strategy. Some people like to bet small amounts on many different outcomes in order to increase their chances of winning overall. Others prefer to put all their money down on one big bet, with the hope of winning big if they're correct about the outcome.

Once you've taken all these things into account, it's time to make your decision on who will win!

#  Cavaliers Favored in NBA Finals Despite Injury Issues

LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers open up as 3.5-point favorites in the NBA Finals, despite their injury issues. The Golden State Warriors, who are coming off a dominating performance against the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals, are listed as 2.5-point underdogs.

This year’s NBA Finals matchup is headlined by superstars LeBron James and Kevin Durant, who are both in the conversation for best player in the world. James is looking to make his eighth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals and win his fourth championship, while Durant is looking for his first ring after leaving Oklahoma City last offseason.

The Warriors have been one of the best teams in NBA history over the past three seasons, winning two championships and making it to the NBA Finals all three years. However, they will be facing a much more difficult test this year with LeBron James’ Cavs.

James has been on an absolute tear this postseason, averaging 34 points per game on 54% shooting from the field and 43% shooting from three-point range. He has also averaged nine rebounds and eight assists per game. Kyrie Irving has also played well this postseason, averaging 24 points and five assists per game. However, JR Smith has been inconsistent and Tristan Thompson has not been very productive on offense.

The Warriors have had their own injury issues this postseason, most notably with Kevin Durant’s calf injury. Durant is expected to play in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday, but he is not 100% healthy. Stephen Curry has also been dealing with a knee injury but is expected to be fully healthy for Game 1. Klay Thompson has been playing well this postseason despite nursing an ankle injury.

Both teams are incredibly talented and evenly matched, so it will likely come down to who plays better overall basketball over the course of seven games. The Cavaliers certainly have more question marks heading into the series than the Warriors do, but they are still favored due to LeBron James’ brilliance and homecourt advantage.

#  WNBA Season Tips Off With Plenty of Uncertainty

The WNBA season tips off on Sunday with plenty of uncertainty. The Connecticut Sun are the defending champions, but they have plenty of competition in a league that looks more competitive than ever.

There is no dominant team in the WNBA this season. The Sun, Los Angeles Sparks, Minnesota Lynx, and Seattle Storm are all contenders, but there are plenty of other teams that could make a run at the title.

The Phoenix Mercury, Washington Mystics, and Dallas Wings all made big offseason acquisitions and could be dark horses in the race for the championship.

This year's WNBA draft was also incredibly deep, with many talented players coming into the league. The rookies are already making an impact, with A'ja Wilson and Kelsey Plum leading the way.

Plum was the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft and has been impressive in the preseason. She is already one of the best players in the league and will only continue to get better as she adapts to the pro game.

Wilson was drafted third overall by the Las Vegas Aces and has already established herself as one of the most promising young players in the league. She is a physical specimen and has a lot of upside.

There are plenty of other young players who will make an impact this season, including Diamond DeShields (Chicago Sky), Layshia Clarendon (Atlanta Dream), Brittney Griner (Phoenix Mercury), Elena Delle Donne (Washington Mystics), Tina Charles (New York Liberty), and Maya Moore (Minnesota Lynx).

This season is shaping up to be one of the best in WNBA history. There are no clear favorites, so it should be a fun and exciting race to the finish line.

#  Mayweather vs McGregor Betting Odds Continue to Shift

 Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor are set to face off in a boxing match on August 26th, and the betting odds for the fight continue to shift. As of Friday, Mayweather was still a heavy favorite, but his odds continue to decline as public money continues to pour in on McGregor.

As of Saturday morning, Mayweather’s odds were down to -550, while McGregor’s were up at +375. That means that a $100 bet on Mayweather would win just $18, while a $100 bet on McGregor would win $375.

It’s not surprising that Mayweather is still seen as the favorite, given his undefeated record in boxing matches. But the fact that his odds are continuing to decline tells us that there is a lot of money being bet on McGregor.

If you’re thinking about betting on the fight, now might be the time to do it. McGregor’s odds won’t stay this high for much longer – especially if he manages to pull off an upset victory over Mayweather.
