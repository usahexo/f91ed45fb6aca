The blue light means that the machine is ready to pay out money. The red light means that the machine is not ready to pay out money. When both of the lights are on, it means that the machine is ready to pay out money and also has a bonus available.

If you see the blue light on, you can be sure that you will be able to get your money back from the machine eventually. If you see the red light on, you should move to another machine, as this one is not ready to pay out yet.

When you are playing at a Hoffman slot machine, there are some things you need to be aware of in order to make the most of your experience. One such thing is what the double light on the machine means.

The double light is located just to the right of the payout window and it will start blinking when you have hit a winning combination. This blinking light signals that you need to pull the handle again in order to collect your payout.

It is important to keep an eye on this light, because if it goes out, it means that your payout has been processed and you will no longer be able to collect any additional winnings from that spin.

So, now that you know what the double light means, be sure to keep an eye on it and make sure you pull the handle again when it starts blinking!
