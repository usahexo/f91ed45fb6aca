#  How to Setup Benicio Del Toro's Schecter Blackjack ATX C8

In this article, we're going to be setting up Benicio Del Toro's Schecter Blackjack ATX C8. The process is relatively simple, and can be completed in just a few steps.

The first thing you'll need to do is remove the strings from the instrument. This can be done by loosening the tuning pegs at the headstock, and then removing the strings one at a time. Be sure to keep track of which string goes where, as you will need to re-string the guitar in the same order later on.

Once the strings have been removed, you can then take off the back panel of the guitar. This can be done by removing the six screws that hold it in place. Once the screws have been removed, you can then slide the panel off of the guitar.

The next step is to install the bridge. This can be done by placing it in between the two posts on the body of the guitar, and then tightening down its screws. Be sure to use a screwdriver that is appropriately sized for these screws, or you may damage them.

Next, you'll need to install the nut. This can be done by placing it at the top of the neck of the guitar, and then tightening down its screws. Again, use a screwdriver that is appropriately sized for these screws, or you may damage them.

Now it's time to install the pickups. This can be done by locating their posts on either side of the bridge, and then inserting and tightening their screws.

Once all of these components have been installed, you'll then need to re-string your guitar. This can be done by starting with the low E string, and working your way up to the high E string. Be sure to follow proper stringing procedure (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IOMnCvxWf4&t=569s), as improperly strung guitars may not play correctly.

Once your guitar has been re-strung, you can then tune it using an electronic tuner or by ear. You should now be ready to start playing!
