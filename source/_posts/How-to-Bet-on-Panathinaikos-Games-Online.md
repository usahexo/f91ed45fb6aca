#  What are the Odds on Panathinaikos? 

The Panathinaikos Sports Club, more commonly known as Panathinaikos or Panathinaiko, is a professional Greek football club. In their early years, they were one of the top teams in Greece but have since seen a decline in their ranking. Nonetheless, they are still considered a powerhouse in the Greek Football League and continue to compete in European tournaments.

As with any sports team, estimating their odds for any given competition is difficult. However, we can take a look at their past performances and try to make reasonable assumptions based on that information.

One of their most recent successes was in the 2017-2018 season when they won the Greek Football Cup. They also managed to make it to the semi-finals of the Europa League but were eventually defeated by Arsenal. Their UEFA coefficient rankings have been slipping in recent years, but they are still ranked within the top 100 clubs in Europe.

For upcoming competitions such as the UEFA Europa League 2019-2020 season, Panathinaikos are likely to be contenders but not favourites. Based on their past performances and current rankings, we would give them odds of around 18/1 to win the tournament.
