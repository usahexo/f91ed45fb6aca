#  Hollywood Casino in Dayton reports record-breaking Locality Information!

The Hollywood Casino in Dayton, Ohio recently announced that it set a new record for most money ever gambled in the history of the casino. Officials say that this is great news for the local economy and will likely bring in more revenue for the city.

 This news comes as a surprise to many since the casino has only been open for a few months. The previous record was held by the Hollywood Casino in Toledo, which has been around for much longer.

According to casino officials, this milestone was achieved thanks to the increased popularity of electronic gaming machines. These machines allow players to bet on games such as poker, roulette, and blackjack without having to visit a physical location.

This trend is not just limited to Hollywood Casino Dayton; electronic gaming is becoming increasingly popular at casinos throughout the state. In fact, experts predict that over half of all casino revenue in Ohio will come from these types of machines by 2020.

The Hollywood Casino Dayton is not alone in its success; other casinos in the area are also reporting record-breaking numbers. The Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati, for example, recently announced that it had brought in over $100 million in revenue during its first year of operation.

It’s clear that Ohio’s casinos are booming and that they are providing a significant boost to the local economy. If you’re interested in cashing in on this growth, be sure to visit one of Ohio’s many casinos soon!

#  Day one a success at Hollywood Casino in Dayton - now onto the next level!

The first day of my $10,000 bankroll challenge at Hollywood Casino in Dayton was a success. I started by playing lower stakes no-limit Texas hold’em and managed to work my way up to the $1/$2 tables.

I stuck to a conservative strategy and only played hands that I felt had a good chance of winning. This led to me losing a little money in the beginning, but I was able to make back most of my losses by the end of the day.

Overall, I ended up winning $128 on Day 1. This gives me a total bankroll of $10,128 heading into Day 2.

Now that I have some experience under my belt, I’m going to raise the stakes and play at the $2/$4 tables tomorrow. Wish me luck!
